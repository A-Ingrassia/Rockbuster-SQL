Analysis of a fictional movie rental company’s data using SQL, answering key business questions related to movie revenue,

### Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a fictional movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

My goal is to help Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence department with the 
launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, 
from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries. My first task is to load 
all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system. Then, I'll use SQL 
to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
