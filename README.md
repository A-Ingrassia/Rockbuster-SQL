# Rockbuster SQL Queries
These are some of the more complex SQL queries associated with my third CareerFoundry
project, which revolves around a fictional movie rental company called "Rockbuster
Stealth LLC". A general overview of the project is as follows:

"Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

You’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI)
department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI
department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related
queries. Your first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database
management system. Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have."
